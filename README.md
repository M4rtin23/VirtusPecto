# VirtusPecto
VirtusPecto is meant to be a game where you fight monsters with magic and some special cards that allow you to summon magical creatures and cast spells.

It uses [GameBuilder](https://github.com/M4rtin23/GameBuilder), the engine I've built along this game's development.


## The project's history
This is a project started on June 2018. It was the first graphical game I started programming when I switched to Linux.
Despite not being able to finish or even make a playable game out of it, I've learnt many things during it's development. And now I'm making it publicly available as it's been a long time since I did anything related to this project and I don't want it to die.

I hope that, if you are interested in it, can help you learn something.
